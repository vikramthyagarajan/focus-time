The year is 2020, a mutant virus ravages the planet, while a lone outlaw sits atop his Macbook looking to find the meaning of life. And then it clicks, the answer to cure the world and purge it of all its sin - Another Todo App

## Backstory on our protagonist

Vikram's been out of the tech game for almost a year. The signs are there - his fingers are slow, unsure of its ability. Even his "Programmer is just someone who turns coffee into code" shirt lies in tatters at the corner of the room. The situation is dire, and who knows if he will ever be able to code again.

He sits in front of his old familiar home desk again, adjusting his eyes to the blue screen again. "Javascript?" he says, holding a scant cigar between his lips and leaving a whiff of smoke in its trail. "I haven't heard that name in years"

Reluctantly he whips out his bag and removes the stickers that once populated his favorite laptop for years. He'd taken them out much likr badge is ripped out of a detective that has been suspended of duty. But he couldn't ignore the call anymore. He could no longer live in a world where he didn't know what Kubernetes is.

## Call to adventure

Some might say he wasn't needed. That the world could live without another Todo app. "But is it worth it?" comes a fast reply from Vikram. His cigar is still not halfway completed - he's actually not much of a cigar guy and is deeply regretting his decision. But Vikram does not shy away from commitment - except when the time he said he's done with tech forever and wanted to delve into music and comedy. But I digress.

"The fate of the world hangs in the balance. It seems like the tech world is sufferring and wants me back", he says. 
```It is not. ```
"In many ways I feel like my leaving tech caused this whole crisis the world is going through", he says.
```It did not. ```
"Rest assured I'm back again", he says.
``` This might in some ways be worse than the pandemic. I hope he doesn't break the internet ```

## A Happy Ending

This might not be your typical story, and this might not be the ending that you expected. But here we are - reckoning with the truth of the world, a singular face of good in the undying depths of evil. A simple Todo App built in Next.js and GraphQL and Apollo, seeking to break down your life into smaller segments so you can focus on them one at a time, including giving you analytics on where you're falling behind. 

Will this Todo App solve the pandemic? 
It will not. 
But will it make you more productive? 
Doubtful. 
Will it be finished?
Absolutely not. It's like you don't even know me

And so we sign off into a future of unknowns, we don't know the answers to many questions. But we live another day to figure out the answer to the most important question - What the fuck is a Kubernetes
